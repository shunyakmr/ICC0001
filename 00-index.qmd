## Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Located beside Regent’s Park, the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre is one of the UK’s most recognized Muslim institutions. Opened in 1977, it was established to serve both the spiritual and educational needs of the Muslim community. The mosque is known for its iconic golden dome, welcoming atmosphere and commitment to promoting inter-faith unity. It hosts daily prayers, lectures and cultural events, attracting visitors from around the world.

This module is designed for new Muslims and for anyone who wants to **refresh their understanding of Salah (the prayer)**.

We created this module at the ICC because many of the resources available today on videos and booklets can be a bit overwhelming.

They often include:

-   Too many **Sunnah (recommended)** actions, which are not obligatory for the Salah to be valid.
-   Content exclusively in **Arabic**, which can make learning difficult or discouraging for beginners.
-   A lack of clear structure where many do not explain the difference between what is **essential** and **optional**, or how to build up your Salah **step by step**.

As a result, learning how to pray can feel confusing or take much longer than it should.

## Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

We focus on keeping things simple, practical and spiritually meaningful.

In this module, you will learn:

1.  The **pillars and required actions** of the Salah, what you need to do for your Salah to be valid.
2.  How to recite **Surat Al-Fatihah**, the essential chapter in every unit of Salah plus and **Tashahud** which is essential also.
3.  The **basic rules** related to Salah like cleanliness, direction, timing and join a congregation.
4.  The spiritual meaning of Salah like how it connects you with your Creator and brings peace to the heart.

<!--# Perhaps change the order of above and make it link better to the whole module structure -->

Once you have learned the basics, you will be in a strong position to gradually add more **Sunnah practices** and deepen your Salah over time.

We hope this module helps you feel confident in your Salah and brings you closer to Allah, InShaAllah!
