## Salah is a Connection with Your Creator

-   As Muslims, our relationship with Allah is our top priority

-   At the heart of that relationship are the five daily Salaat.

-   When you pray, you are in a conversation with your Creator!

-   The second pillar of Islam and the only worship made obligatory in the seventh heaven. <!--# Not very clear what you mean here. Perhaps could even make a section about it? -->
