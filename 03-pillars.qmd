title: "Pillars and Obligatory Acts"
---

In salah, **pillars (fard 'ayn)** are essential actions that invalidate the prayer if omitted, whether intentionally or unintentionally. **Obligatory acts (wajib)** are also necessary, but if forgotten, they can be compensated for by performing the prostrations of forgetfulness (*sujood as-sahw*).

::: callout-tip
The third category is **Sunnah acts**, which are recommended but not mandatory. They enhance the prayer but do not invalidate it if omitted. More on @sec-act-pillars .
